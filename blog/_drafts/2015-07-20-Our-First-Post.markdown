Here's a quick post I made by adding a file to the `/blog/_drafts` folder. Once the post is ready to publish you can move it to `/blog/_posts` and then rebuild the the Jekyll site to update and show the new post.

Find more info here: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/

To do:  
- Main OpCode NAV BAR: add a "Blog" link to pointing to `/blog`  
- re-building the Jekyll page:  
  - PRODUCTION: figure out a way to automate or ease the rebuilding of the Jekyll site once somebody posts something new  
  - DEVELOPMENT/LOCAL: add the "Extra: Automation" rake task from http://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-rails/  
- Jekyll noob guide  
  - creating post w/ frontmatter  
  - rebuilding blog  

Done:
- move cookie-cutter "about" page to "drafts"
- BLOG: add a "Home" link to the site root url so people can get back to main OpCode site and out of the blog  

Future group tasks:
- consider adding new theme
- add some posts!
