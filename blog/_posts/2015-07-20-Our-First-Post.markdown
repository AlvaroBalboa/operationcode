Here's a quick post I made by adding a file to the `/blog/_posts` folder.

Once the post is saved you have to rebuild the the Jekyll site to update and show the new post.

To do:  
- get rid of the about page in `blog/about.md`  
- BLOG: add a "Home" link to the site root url so people can get back to main OpCode site and out of the blog  
- MAIN NAV BAR: add a "Blog" link to pointing to `/blog`  
- consider adding new themes  
- add some posts!  
- re-building the Jekyll page:  
  - PRODUCTION: figure out a way to automate or ease the rebuilding of the Jekyll site once somebody posts something new  
  - DEVELOPMENT/LOCAL: add the "Extra: Automation" rake task from http://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-rails/
