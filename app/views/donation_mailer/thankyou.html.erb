Dear <%= @donator.first_name.capitalize %>, <br />
<p>Thanks to your generation donation, a Soldier, Sailor, Marine, Air Force, and Coast Guard Veteran will not be left behind in the digital age. Your donation of $<%= @donator.amount %> will help transitioning military, citizen-soldiers, Veterans, and military families learn to code and ensure they don't get left behind in a 21st century new skills economy.</p>

<p>Thanks to your generous contribution, Operation Code can continue to expand and serve more Veterans globally in their pursuit to become software developers through our innovative programs & services, including the Software Mentor Protégé Program, code school and conference scholarships, web apprenticeship, employer services, pro-bono legal support, and New GI Bill/code school accreditation. Together we'll fill the nation's technical talent shortage with American patriots who've served their country and can code.</p>

<p>Today, you joined us in making modern software development education accessible to all who've served and thanks to you, our 377 Veterans will get the support they've earned through their service and sacrifice to this great country.</p>

<p>Finally, we'd appreciate it if you'd share our Operation Code mission to your friends, family and colleagues on the important work Operation Code is doing to help those who've served learn software development.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,<br>
David Molina<br>
ex-Army Captain<br>
Founder & Executive Director, Operation Code</p>
