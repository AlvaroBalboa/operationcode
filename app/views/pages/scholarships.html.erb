        <p class="lead">Many respective <a href="/codeschools">code schools</a> offer military/veterans discounts. Here are a few code schools that we're proud to partner and offer Operation Code military/veterans community scholarships:</p>

        <p class="lead"><a href="http://go.flatironschool.com/operation-code-overview">The Flatiron School</a></p>
          <p>The Flatiron School is teaming up with Operation Code to offer up to $25,000 in scholarships for veterans to participate in the Learn-Verified program: $500 off the first month's tuition for the first 50 eligible applicants.</p>

          <p>Not sure about committing full-time? Feel free to sign up for <a href="https://learn.co/">Learn.co</a>, an online platform to get introduced to web development and Ruby on Rails. Request an invite <a href="https://learn.co/join/operation-code">here</a> and then join the #learn-dot-co channel in our Slack if you get stuck.</p>

        <p class="lead"><a href="http://try.bloc.io/operation-code-bootcamp-scholarship/">Bloc.io</a></p>
          <p>Veterans have already served their country. To honor their sacrifice, Bloc and Operation Code are offering all veterans a $1000 tuition credit toward Bloc's Web Developer Track. The remainder of the tuition can be financed.  We look forward to working with Operation Code into the future to help fill our nation's technical talent shortage.</p>

        <p class="lead"><a href="https://launchschool.com/blog/operation-code-scholarship/">Launch School</a></p>
          <p>We are proud to partner with Operation Code to provide two full scholarships to the Launch School program. We are proud to support veterans and will grant one scholarship to a male veteran, and another scholarship to a female veteran.</p>
