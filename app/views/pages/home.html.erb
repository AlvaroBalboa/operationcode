          We use Slack, a real-time messaging app to post questions and answers, and share snippets of code. When that doesn't work, we can jump on a Screenhero and pair-program even faster sharing screens.

          <h2>501(c)(3) Confirmed</h2>
          <p>By David Molina</p>
        </a>
        <p>
          At 1236 PST today, we received a much anticipated and welcomed phone call from the IRS regarding our submitted 501(c)(3) application. After some straggling to determine where the fax could be sent in, I took down the information from the agent and called our banker, Mr. Stanley Carpenter at Beneficial State Bank with the request for fax support. At 1419, the official 501(c)(3) was in our inbox. <a href="https://operationcode.org/blog/2016/05/04/501c3-confirmed.html">[Read more]</a>

          For some veterans learning to code, the idea of going to a technical conference is a daunting task. You don’t know the jargon that well, you don’t know all the big names or faces, and you often times don’t know anyone else at the event. It’s a veritable mix of excitement to start getting into the community and the fear that you won’t or don’t belong. That’s exactly how I felt...<a href="https://operationcode.org/blog/2016/04/26/ruby-on-ales-2016.html">[Read more]</a>

          One of the best ways to learn, network, and find job opportunities in the IT industry is through attending conferences. My very first tech conference was Cascadia Ruby 2011 where I was amazed at the variety of talks (many covering technologies and techniques I was immediately able to apply in my work)... <a href="https://operationcode.org/blog/2016/03/02/conference-scholarships.html">[Read more]</a>
