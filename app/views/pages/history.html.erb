        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <h2>2012: It all starts with a hackathon</h2>
        <li><p class="lead">Our founder and retired U.S. Army Captain David Molina attends his first hackathon in New York City. After a weekend learning at <a href="http://angelhack.com">AngelHack</a> he is inspired to pursue software craftsmanship as a post-military occupation. He submits his application to The Flatiron School while on active-duty only to discover that the program does not accept the New GI Bill as payment.</li></p>
        <li><p class="lead">Molina exits military serve in early 2013 and begins to self-learn Ruby on Rails, a full-stack web development platform for building comprehensive web applications attending <a href="http://bmoreonrails.org">Bmore on Rails</a> meetups and taking <a href="http://onemonth.com">One Month Rails</a> online.</p></li>
        <h2>2013: The vision becomes clearer</h2>
        <li><p class="lead">Molina attends <a href="http://railsconf.com">RailsConf</a> as a scholarship fellow and is introduced to the Portland ruby group and rubyists from around the world.</p></li>
        <li><p class="lead">Molina is selected and attends <a href="http://techstars.com/patriotbootcamp">Techstars Patriot Boot Camp (PBC)</a> at George Washington University. There he raises the problem to guest speaker and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine of the inability of using the New GI Bill to go to code school and prepare for the modern workforce. Before departing D.C., Molina takes an Uber to the U.S. Capitol and meets with U.S. Army Congressional Fellow Ben Culver. Culver recommends gathering the following data:</br>
        (1) Number of veterans who are interested in coding as a post-military occupation.</br>
        (2) Assessing the interest among all code schools nationally.</br>
        (3) Determining the overall associated costs with implementing a broad reaching program.
