Dear <%= @veteran.name %>, <br />
Thanks for signing up and joining our ranks! I'm honored and humbled by your participation.</p>

As you may know I applied to code school while still on active-duty w/ my New GI Bill and was shocked to know I couldn't use it. This was in 2012. Again, I tried in 2014 and same answer. While I've self-learned, attended a <a href="http://angelhack.com/">Hackathon</a>, both <a href="http://bmoreonrails.org/">Bmore on Rails</a> and <a href="http://pdxruby.org/">Portland Ruby Brigade</a>, enrolled in <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> and use <a href="https://hackhands.com/">HackHands</a> regularly it's still challenging to learn to code over the long-run while still meeting monthly obligations to family. I don't believe it's the best way to learn in particular for Veterans transitioning. Reality is it shouldn't be this challenging when we've already served our country and desire to go to code school and make the transition to be a software developer.</p>

As an unemployed/underemployed Veteran, I decided to do something about it last summer after learning enough Ruby on Rails and launched a petition and this page to gather signatures of Veterans and fellow supporters to tell Congress to expand the New GI Bill to include code school tuition, room and board. Many stepped up to tackle this issue. U.S. Army Veteran Charles Sipe wrote, <a href="https://www.switchup.org/blog/why-veterans-will-make-excellent-programmers">Why Veterans Will Make Excellent Programmers,"</a>and Susy Raybon took <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/operation-code-provides-career-opportunities-for-military-veterans">interest</a> in Operation Code which has helped us grow our ranks. Ruby on Rails developer James Davis became our first contributor and helping drive the architecture that will support our growth. But we need you to share your story of service to country, desire to learn to code, and challenges you face in your transition.</p>

In January we evolved as a non-profit to better meet our mission and growing ranks, and expanded our scope on code school scholarships and software mentorship. In the coming months, we'll be both raising funds and awarding scholarships until the New GI Bill kicks in. In the intermediate, you can request a software mentor by simply replying w/ your programming language request (HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, Swift, Ruby on Rails).

Again, welcome aboard and thank you for joining us in this important fight as we get more military Veterans coding for gainful employment as software developers. Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/opcod3us">Twitter</a> to stay up-to-date.</p>
