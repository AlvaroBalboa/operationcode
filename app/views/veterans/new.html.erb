        <p class="lead">Our goal is to expand the New GI Bill to cover code schools so that Veterans can learn to code.</p>
        <p>In the U.S. of A, over 130,000 software jobs open annually and 30,000 are filled by computer science 
        	undergraduates. Today, short-term code schools have been created to fill this demand for junior and 
        	entry-level programmers. We believe Veterans should be able to use their New GI Bill to learn to code 
        	and help close this gap. If you're a Veteran and want to learn to code on the New GI Bill, join us.
